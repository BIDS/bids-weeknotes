#### 🌹

  * It was so great to have a big, wide-ranging conversation in person - I think I surprised him with some of the directions I wanted to go... but in a good way!
* Got an MOU signed 💪

#### 🌱

* The GeoJupyter Hackathon this week was really exciting - such great people and a lot of coherence around the next steps we need to take!

#### 🌵 
  
* Felt overwhelmed by the amount of grant writing work that I wasn't totally prepared for.

    * I was so proud of the event and that we were co-hosting through the AI Futures Lab 🌍 💚
  * Really great people - what a joy!
    * And I found the activities to identify the biggest challenge particularly valuable.... roadmaps... they're hard!

    They've been so great and it has been so much fun having a team at BIDS working on communications!

  * Chaired steering group meeting - went well - I think we got to a good place with the delivery groups as having _bidirectional_ accountability.
     * That's something that was implicit but that we had never made clear (even in my mind) - so I'm really glad about that!
* Scientific Python
  * Had a great conversation with MM about community calls in SciPy and what might work for Scientific Python / scientific Python more broadkly 🌳🐍
