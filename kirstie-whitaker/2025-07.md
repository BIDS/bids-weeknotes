#### 🌹

* So much fun brainstorming our newsletter strategy with LWH
  * It really felt like we got to a deep alignment on the purpose - and its so close to what we were doing but now _intentionally_ designed :love_letter:

#### 🌱

* Such a helpful deep dive with SvdW and JM - I had a big breakthrough in correcting a misunderstanding (of mine!) that opens up many paths that I had thought weren't on the possibility tree!

#### 🌵 
  
* It feels like the semester is going to start so soooon - eek!!
  * This is also an opportunity but, wow, if only there were more hours in the day 😬
  * Oh, and I was sick on Monday - the sleep was good but I'm now even more behind 😩

### 🤝 Reciprocal support

#### Who did I help?

* Got a job offer signed!
  Excited to welcome a new team member in September!
* Gave BS some ideas for her lightning talk on Scientific Python at SciPy 

#### Who helped me?

* JM and SvdW gave me so much of their time - and were willing to have some really tough conversations balancing uncertainty and hope about the future 💗
* BIDS interns are bringing me so much joy with their social media posts 📢 
* LWH did the deep thinking and structured writing to get us articulating BIDS communications strategy so much more - I SO appreciated that careful work.

#### What did I do?

##### BIDS Leadership

* So lovely to welcome TTa back!
  * Had a great catch up with him.

* BIDS leadership meeting - useful to sync up - although I'm not doing a good enough job sending agendas around 😭
* Fantastic BIDS newsletter purpose brainstorming meeting with LWH - I left feeling so energized and appreciative 💌
* Lovely coffee chat with GM - so fun to see so much alignment around how open source can make a positive change in the world.
