#### 🌹

* Got elected as Chair of the Turing Way Steering Committee :sparkling_heart:

#### 🌱

* Welcomed JK and KC as interns! 👋
  * So excited about them contributing to comms for BIDS, Turing Way, Jupyter and Scientific Python over the summer!

#### 🌵 
  
* Felt a bit lonely at some points in the week... a characteristic of the role I have, but tough sometimes too :slightly_frowning_face:

### 🤝 Reciprocal support

#### Who did I help?

* I welcomed the BIDS interns and gave them a bit of background on reproducibility and the power of open source.

#### Who helped me?

* RC has been AMAZING this week and last with loads of really constructive brainstorming 🙏
* ThT - super helpful information on reimbursements for travel requests.

### Activities / tasks

#### What did I do?

* Jupyter
  * Joined first meeting of the Outreach and Engagement Committee for JupyterCon
    * Created Zulip channel
    * Identified that speakers don't need to pay for their registration - need to do a comms blast on that!
    * Got [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kirstiewhitaker_call-for-proposals-cfp-lf-events-activity-7341902703083569156-QamF) and [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/kirstiejane.bsky.social/post/3ls2qyzxabs22) posts out to promote, shared on Zulip.
    * Created issues in JupyterHub ([#788](https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/788)) and JupyterBook ([#42](https://github.com/jupyter-book/team-compass/issues/42)) to track our submissions.
    * Pinged the Scientific Python discord just in case someone there was interested in applying.
  * Caught up with CH and had a really good brainstorm around community health & engagement more broadly 🌸
* JupyterHub
  * Got the reimbursements and AI Futures Lab feedback form sent out (finally!)
    * LH did a great job giving me feedback on the feedback form - hopefully we have something that works for futures sessions now too!
  * Opened an issue about Collaboration Cafe times ([#790](https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/790))
  * Got access to the team-compass repository 😍 🥰
* BIDS interns
  * Welcomed JW and KC
  * Showed them the WeWork space and explained a little about open source & reproducibility.
    Had a great lunch chat about incentive structures - the tensions between doing work that elevates everyone vs prioritising individual success.
  * Opened an issue for KC to work on as part of The Turing Way: ([#4261](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/4261)) 
* Jupyter at BIDS
  * Met with EvD about [National Workshop on Data Science Education](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/dsus/nwdse#) next week
  * Said I'd chair the Friday session - sent an email out to the panel members - added BS to represent Scientific Python 🌳
* BIDS leadership and operations
  * Weekly leadership meeting - small but helpful
  * Collected references as part of recruitment process, sent an email proposing the next steps!
  * Met with ThT to get up to speed on campus policies wrt remote working and particularly focused on travel reimbursements ✈️ 
  * Got a faculty affiliate application over the line with a bit of nudging 😅
* AI Futures Lab
  * Quite a bit of time coordinating the MOU
  * Meeting about acoustic dampening in the seminar space
  * Developed - with LH - a feedback form that we can use going forwards!
* Force11 [PERC Working Group](https://github.com/force11/percwg)
  * Really interesting meeting discussing the difference between executable and interactive content.
    * I think we're leaning towards focusing on interactive rather than executable - which is helpful because I had NOT understood interactive to be the focus at all 😅
    Glad we figured it out!
* Turing Way
  * Steering council
    * Voted for Chair & Secretary roles - got elected to chair 🌺
  * Collaboration Cafe
    * Discussed GitHub issue that KC is going to work on: ([#4261](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/4261)) 
    * Discussed feedback on UK's Data Sharing policy
  * Community Call
    * Participated in the fireside chat with the rest of the steering council
* Scientific Python
  * Did a little bit of emailing about reimbursements 💸

#### What did I not do?

* Paperwork for JupyterHub DEI grant 😩
* Did a bit of thinking and reading about policies for the AI Futures Lab but didn't put pen to paper...
