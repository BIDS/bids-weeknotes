### Inbox tracker

* 💌 115
  * After archiving 9000+ unread emails since 2012 😅

### Rose-bud-thorn

#### 🌹

* Really amazing onboarding experience - the last time I was onboarded I had a few intro meetings that were really far apart.
  There was a lot of sitting around vaguely reading things.
  I thought this would be similar!!
  But no - FP, TT, LWH, AH have all been so generous with their time and introduced me to so many people - what a dream!

#### 🌱

* So so many.
  But lets pick Jupyter and how we can integrate BIDS projects with that open source community.
  * I had a great glass-boarding session with FP to get me up to speed! 🪐

#### 🌵 

* oh, idk, its been amazing so far.
  Really what's going to be hard is the shorter hours for daycare here compared to the UK!
  I feel like Cinderella at the end of every day 👠

#### Who did I help?

* Showed LWH how to archive a bunch of emails 📤

#### Who helped me?

* EM from ERSO talked me through submitting some immigration paperwork (importantly!)
