  * This was going great until I got added to a million trainings :joy:

### Rose-bud-thorn

#### 🌹

* I really enjoyed the UC Berkeley all staff forum with the Chancellor.
  * In particular he focused on burnout and making sure that staff feel appreciated which feels like such an important thing for someone so senior to say!

#### 🌱

* Such a fun meeting with JM and ST - our inaugural UC Berkeley OSPO steering group meeting! :dizzy:

#### 🌵 
  
* OMG my participation in _The Turing Way_ collaboration cafe was a complete disaster - Mackenzie got really jealous that I was on a call during breakfast and was not her best self :weary:
  * A lesson learned - I have GOT to get out of bed earlier!! :bed::sunrise:

### 🤝 Reciprocal support

* I'm in the Gateway Space meeting now - so helping out FP with taking a little responsibility off his plate.
  A fascinating introduction to the different teams within CDSS!

#### Who helped me?

* I'm not sure that this really counts but I SO loved the 3 different walking meetings (CH, DS and SP!)
  They're so much fun and its such a fantastic opportunity to get outside in the sunshine especially as a solo parent!

##### BIDS Leadership

  And got it set up!

##### Trainings & Outreach

* Joined Turing Way collaboration cafe - fun but a complete disaster with a jealous 2 year old.... a new plan must emerge for the next one!
  * Also included a really valuable meeting with the Voices of JupyterHub project team - excited for the interviews to be completed!

#### 🌹

* Really amazing onboarding experience - the last time I was onboarded I had a few intro meetings that were really far apart.
  There was a lot of sitting around vaguely reading things.
  I thought this would be similar!!
  But no - FP, TT, LWH, AH have all been so generous with their time and introduced me to so many people - what a dream!

#### 🌱

* So so many.
  But lets pick Jupyter and how we can integrate BIDS projects with that open source community.
  * I had a great glass-boarding session with FP to get me up to speed! 🪐

#### 🌵 

* oh, idk, its been amazing so far.
  Really what's going to be hard is the shorter hours for daycare here compared to the UK!
  I feel like Cinderella at the end of every day 👠
