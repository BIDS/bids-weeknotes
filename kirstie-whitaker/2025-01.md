* Really amazing onboarding experience - the last time I was onboarded I had a few intro meetings that were really far apart.
  There was a lot of sitting around vaguely reading things.
  I thought this would be similar!!
  But no - FP, TT, LWH, AH have all been so generous with their time and introduced me to so many people - what a dream!

#### üå±

  But lets pick Jupyter and how we can integrate BIDS projects with that open source community.
  * I had a great glass-boarding session with FP to get me up to speed! ü™ê

#### üåµ 

* oh, idk, its been amazing so far.
  Really what's going to be hard is the shorter hours for daycare here compared to the UK!
