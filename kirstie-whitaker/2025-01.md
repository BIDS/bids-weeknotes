* Really amazing onboarding experience - the last time I was onboarded I had meetings that were so far apart.
  There was a lot of sitting around vaguely reading things.
  I thought this would be similar!!
  But no - FP, TT, LWH, AH have all been so generous with their time and introduced me to so many people - what a dream!
