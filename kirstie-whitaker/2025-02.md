### Rose-bud-thorn

#### üåπ

* I think I'm going to pick my time with the DSE folks as my rose this week - what a warm and friendly culture they've built.
  * And they're SO keen to work with BIDS - I was really unsure how we'd be able to both exist in the "same" space but it feels eminently do-able given their collaborative and open ethos :pray: :earth_americas: :green_heart:

#### üå±

* We were in a bit of a spiderman meme of everyone pointing at everyone else in the Voices of JupyterHub project but I think we've navigated that with everyone feeling very positive and friendly.
  * I'm excited to be stil involved! :sparkling_heart:

#### üåµ 
  
* I critised someone else for being indelicate about their strong opinions and then literally did the same thing with one of my strong opinions :woman_facepalming:
  * Aaaaah, to not live in a glass house...

### ü§ù Reciprocal support

#### Who did I help?

* A team member (maybe a couple of team members!) to feel seen, understood and appreciated.
  * Lots of listening to understand, a few targetted questions, and some reflecting back.

#### Who helped me?

* LH and MB submitted my relocation expenses!
  * I so appreciate the nudge to get that to the top of my to do list :pray:
